## About the data

Data is collected and distributed by the US Department of Education. The
raw data provided in their website are non-standardized, and need some
extensive data cleaning to make them useful as a whole.

In this package, the raw data files were sourced from their website,
cleaned, standardized, and joined together into one dataset:

-   `pell`: For each year since 1999 to 2017 how much total money was
    disbursed as Pell grant by each institution across the USA.

## Example

Load the dataset:

``` r
library(pell)
data(pell)
```

Explore first 5 rows:

``` r
head(pell)
